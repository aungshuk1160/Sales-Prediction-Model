The Sales Prediction Model is a machine learning project designed to forecast future product sales using historical data and market features. It applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression techniques to identify sales patterns and predict demand accurately. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights and visualizations, along with model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score. Developed with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, this model helps businesses make data-driven decisions for inventory planning, marketing strategy, and resource optimization. All experiments are documented in Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.
